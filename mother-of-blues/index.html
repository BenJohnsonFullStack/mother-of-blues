            <h2>Who Was Ma Rainey?</h2>
            <p>Upon her posthumous induction in 1990, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame introduced Ma Rainey sweetly and simply: "Ma Rainey may not have been the first woman to sing the blues, but she might as well have."</p> 
                <p>Ma Rainey's legacy is well-known within the international community of musicians, but is less known in more casual circles than stars such as Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, and others. Bonnie Raitt, who announced Ma Rainey's overdue induction, said that "The fire and gusto of Ma Rainey's singing was exceptional." Performers that followed in Ma Rainey's footsteps owe her a great debt, and her performances and personality continue to touch audiences the world over long after her passing.</p>
